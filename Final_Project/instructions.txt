Assume the daily deaths are Poisson distributed with parameter lambda. 

Assume an Exponential prior (with mean beta) on lambda. 
To find beta for the prior, equate the mean of the Exponential prior to that of the Poisson lambda_MME. 

That is, find the MME of lambda using the first week’s data, 
and equate this lambda to the mean of Exp(1/beta) to find beta for the prior. 
Use first week’s data to obtain the posterior for lambda via Bayesian inference. 

Now, use second week’s data to obtain the new posterior, using prior as posterior after week 1. 

Repeat till the end of week 4. Plot all posterior distributions on one graph. 

Report the MAP for all posteriors.
